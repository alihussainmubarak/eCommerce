Laravel 6 eCommerce

In this project, I built a sample and dynamic shopping cart with Laravel and Bootstrap framework. First of all, you need to register and login to use this application, then you can add a new product to the shop page as well as delete it from the shop page, after that you can add the product to the cart. The cart page displays the list of products that are added to the cart with prices, quantities and total prices.
